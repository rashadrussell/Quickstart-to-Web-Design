    <h3>
        <a href="http://www.wow4u.com/givingyourbest/">Comfort Zone</a>
    </h3>
    <h5>Poet: Julie Hebert</h5>

    <div class="stanza">
        <p>We all have a comfort zone,</p>
        <p>In which we all retreat.</p>
        <p>When times get tough it's hard to not</p>
        <p>Feel like you are beat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <p>So when you feel this time approaching,</p>
        <p>And your comfort zones in view.</p>
        <p>Stop and think about what you're feeling,</p>
        <p>And see if what you're feeling is true.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <p>It's good we all have a spot,</p>
        <p>That makes us all feel good.</p>
        <p>But sometimes we may use that spot,</p>
        <p>When it's not necessary that we should.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <p>So next time you feel the need,</p>
        <p>To stay in your comfort zone.</p>
        <p>See if all you really need,</p>
        <p>Is some confidence of your own.</p>
    </div>
